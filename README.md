# Building_Document_Scanner_Using_OPENCV
The objective of this project is to develop a document scanner using OpenCV. 
The scanner will be able to capture images of documents, apply image processing techniques to enhance the quality, and convert them into digital formats.
 By automating the scanning process,we aim to improve efficiency and convenience in document management. This presentation will provide an overview of the existing document scanning systems, their limitations,the proposed system's features and benefits. Additionally, the hardware and software requirements for implementing the scanner will be discussed.
This project leverages the power of OpenCV,an open-source computer vision and machine learning software library to achieve the goal of developing seamless physical documents into digital formats.
In conclusion, the document scanner built using OpenCV represents a significant advancement in document scanning technology, offering improved efficiency, accuracy, and usability.
Where we few Existing Systems(DISADVANTAGES):-
-Limited Compatibility
-Limited Features
-Slow Processing Speed
-Lack of Accuracy
-High Cost
As in the proposed system, features involved i.e.,Image Acquisition, Pre-processing, Document detection, Image Enhancement, Optical character recoginition(OCR).
Performance metrics:-
Precision : Precision measures the accuracy of the positive predictions.(83% - 87%)
Recall : Recall measures the ability of the scanner to detect all relevant document contours.(85% - 95%)
F1 score : The F1 score is the harmonic mean of precision and recall, providing a balanced measure of accuracy.(85% - 95%)
Accuracy : Accuracy measures the overall correctness of the document scanner.(85% - 90%)

Conclusion and Future scope of this project:-
The â€œDocument Scanner using OpenCV" project has demonstrated the successful implementation of an efficient document scanning system. Through the utilization of OpenCV libraries and image processing techniques, the project has achieved the objective of automatically detecting, cropping, and enhancing document images.
There are several avenues for further enhancement and expansion-
Improved Document Detection : Implement advanced machine learning algorithms to enhance document detection accuracy, especially in scenarios with complex backgrounds or overlapping objects.
Multi-page Scanning : Extend the application to support the scanning of multiple pages in a single scan session, enabling users to create multi-page documents or PDF files.
Cloud Integration : Integrate cloud storage services to allow users to upload scanned documents directly to cloud platforms for easy access and sharing.
